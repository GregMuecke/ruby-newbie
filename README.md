So you're very new to Ruby? Good thing you found us!

*We're going to take you on an ADVENTURE!*

This project was started to provide puzzles for people pondering programming.
We found that Ruby was pretty welcoming and provides some great tools to get started in web development.
It's also a beautiful language :-)

## How to get this project on your machine

If you're new to GitHub we recommend using one of the links on the right hand side of this page: `Download ZIP`

Then Unzip into your favorite directory.

## How do I work on it

Open it in your editor of choice. If you don't have a preferred editor, we like to recommend [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) to beginners.
