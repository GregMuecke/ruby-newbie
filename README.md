# New Here?

So you're very new to Ruby? Good thing you found us!

*We're going to take you on an ADVENTURE!*

![Adventure Time!](/adventure_time.gif)

This project was started to provide puzzles for people pondering programming.
We found that Ruby was pretty welcoming and provides some great tools to get started in web development.
It's also a beautiful language :-)

## How do I get everything setup?

There are two good options.

1: Clone the repo on Cloud9 following instructions similar to [Chapter 1: From zero to deploy | Ruby on Rails Tutorial (3rd Ed.) | Softcover.io](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning#sec-up_and_running)
2: Get everything on your local machine
  * Install ruby similar to [Install Rails | Your Guide for Installing Ruby on Rails](http://installrails.com/)
  * If you're new to GitHub we recommend using one of the links on the right hand side of this page: `Download ZIP` or [download the zip here](https://github.com/ZachBeta/ruby_newbie/archive/master.zip)
  * Then Unzip into your favorite directory.
  * Open it in your editor of choice. If you don't have a preferred editor, we like to recommend [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) to beginners.

## How do I run it?

Each README will explain how to open and run the smaller applications.
