# New Here?

So you're very new to Ruby? Good thing you found us!
We're going to take you on an ADVENTURE!
(insert adventure time gif here)

This project was started to provide puzzles for people pondering programming.
We found that Ruby was pretty welcoming and provides some great tools to get started in web development.
It's also a beautiful language :-)
